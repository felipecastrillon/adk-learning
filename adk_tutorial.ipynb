    "### What is the Agent Development Kit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is an open-source, code-first framework for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. Announced at Google Cloud NEXT 2025, it's the same framework that powers Google's own products like Agentspace and Customer Engagement Suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core philosophy:** Agent development should feel like software development — version control, testing, modularity, and code review all apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code-first**: Agents are defined in Python (also TypeScript, Go, Java) — not dragged and dropped\n",
    "- **Model-agnostic**: Optimized for Gemini, but supports 100+ LLMs via LiteLLM (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Mistral, etc.)\n",
    "- **Deployment-agnostic**: Run locally, on Cloud Run, GKE, Vertex AI Agent Engine, or any container host\n",
    "- **Full lifecycle**: Build → Interact → Evaluate → Deploy, all within one framework"

Renewable energy, particularly solar photovoltaics and wind power, has seen unprecedented cost reductions and efficiency gains, making it globally competitive, a trend further supported by breakthroughs in grid-scale energy storage and smarter grids capable of integrating intermittent sources. Concurrently, electric vehicles have made remarkable progress, with battery technology offering improved range, faster charging, and lower manufacturing costs, complemented by an expanding charging infrastructure and enhanced performance. This synergy, where a more robust and renewable-powered grid can efficiently fuel an increasingly adopted fleet of advanced EVs, positions electric transportation as a dominant future solution, deeply intertwined with the broader clean energy transition.\n"
